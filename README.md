***## Introduction
Jetstream is an amazing package for bootstrapping Laravel.
This package is just a package for tweaking some features and adding extra features to it.

## Documentation
The original documentation for Jetstream can be found on the [Jetstream website](https://jetstream.laravel.com).

There has been added a new command, when choosing the inertia stack. 
```
--framework=vue
```
or 
```
--framework=svelte
```



## Current new features or changes
There's no features yet, but there has been added support for a new frontend framework [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) when using the inertia stack.

## Future features
Current thoughts for features to add:
- better handling of invites to team members
- support for multitenancy with sub domains for teams using [Spatie Laravel-mulitenancy](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-multitenancy/v2/introduction)
- Rewrite components to use [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) to support easier theming
- add support to bootstrap with [React](https://reactjs.org/)
